#### Abstract:

Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems, and systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms, or other aspects of the implementation. This specification defines an Actuator profile for Packet Filtering (PF). Packet filtering is a cyber defense mechanism that denies or allows traffic based on static or dynamic properties. The Actuator profile collects Actions, Targets, Arguments, and Specifiers along with conformance clauses to enable the operation of OpenC2 Producers and Consumers in the context of PF.

# 1 Introduction

_The content in this section is non-normative, except where it is marked normative._

**Note:** This Actuator profile is consistent with Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification ([[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10)).

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and control of cyber defense systems and components. OpenC2 typically uses a request-response paradigm where a  Command is encoded by a  Producer  (managing application) and transferred to a  Consumer (managed device or virtualized function) using a secure transfer protocol, and the Consumer acts on the request and responds with status and any other requested information.

This specification defines an Actuator profile for **Packet Filtering (PF)**. In particular, the specification comprises a set of Actions, Targets and Target Specifiers, Command Arguments, and Actuator Specifiers that integrates PF functionality with the OpenC2 Command set. Through this Command set, cyber security orchestrators may gain visibility into and provide control over PF functionality in a manner that is independent of the instance of the PF function. 

All components, devices, and systems that provide PF functionality MUST implement the identified OpenC2 Actions, Targets, Specifiers, and Arguments as specified in the Conformance section of this specification. 

Though cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or instances may implement multiple Actuator profiles, a particular OpenC2 Message may reference at most a single Actuator profile. The scope of this document is limited to PF. 

---

The rest of the specification is organized as follows: 

The remaining of [Section 1](#1-introduction) includes infomation about the IPR policy, terminology used, and document conventions pertinent to this Actuator profile specification.

[Section 2](#2-openc2-language-binding) (normative) binds this particular profile to Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification ([[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10)). It enumerates the components of the Language Specification that are meaningful in the context of PF and also defines components that are applicable to this distinct profile. In addition, Section 2 defines the Commands (i.e., the Action/Target pairs, arguments, an associated specifiers) that are permitted in the context of PF.

[Section 3](#3-conformance-statements) (normative) presents definitive criteria for conformance so that cyber security stakeholders can be assured that their products, instances and/or integrations are compatible with this profile (OpenC2 Actuator Profile for Packet Filtering Version 1.0).

[Appendix E](#appendix-e-sample-commands) (non-normative) provides multiple examples of Commands and associated Responses (JSON serialization).



## 1.1 IPR Policy
This specification is provided under the [Non-Assertion](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#Non-Assertion-Mode) Mode of the [OASIS IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), the mode chosen when the Technical Committee was established. For information on whether any patents have been disclosed that may be essential to implementing this specification, and any offers of patent licensing terms, please refer to the Intellectual Property Rights section of the TC's web page ([https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php)).

## 1.2 Terminology

_This section is normative._

* **Action**: The task or activity to be performed (e.g., 'deny').
* **Actuator**: The function performed by the Consumer that executes the Command (e.g., 'Stateless Packet Filtering').
* **Argument**: A property of a Command that provides additional information on how to perform the Command, such as date/time, periodicity, duration, etc.
* **Command**: A Message defined by an Action-Target pair that is sent from a Producer and received by a Consumer.
* **Consumer**: A managed device / application that receives Commands. Note that a single device / application can have both Consumer and Producer capabilities.
* **Message**: A content- and transport-independent set of elements conveyed between Consumers and Producers.
* **Producer**: A manager application that sends Commands.
* **Response**: A Message from a Consumer to a Producer acknowledging a Command or returning the requested resources or status to a previously received Command.
* **Specifier**: A property or field that identifies a Target or Actuator to some level of precision.
* **Target**: The object of the Action, i.e., the Action is performed on the Target (e.g., IP Address).

## 1.3 Document Conventions
### 1.3.1 Naming Conventions
* [[RFC2119]](#rfc2119)/[[RFC8174]](#rfc8174) key words are in all uppercase.
* All property names and literals are in lowercase, except when referencing canonical names defined in another standard (e.g., literal values from an IANA registry).
* Words in property names are separated with an underscore (_), while words in string enumerations and type names are separated with a hyphen (-).
* The term "hyphen" used here refers to the ASCII hyphen or minus character, which in Unicode is "hyphen-minus", U+002D.

### 1.3.2 Font Colors and Style
The following color, font and font style conventions are used in this document:

* A fixed width font is used for all type names, property names, and literals.
* Property names are in bold style â **'created_at'**.
* All examples in this document are expressed in JSON. They are in fixed width font, with straight quotes, black text and a light shaded background, and 4-space indentation. JSON examples in this document are representations of JSON Objects. They should not be interpreted as string literals. The ordering of object keys is insignificant. Whitespace before or after JSON structural characters in the examples are insignificant [[RFC8259]](#rfc8259).
* Parts of the example may be omitted for conciseness and clarity. These omitted parts are denoted with ellipses (...).

Example:

~~~
{
    "action": "deny",
    "target": {
        "file": {
            "hashes": {
                "sha256": "22fe72a34f006ea67d26bb7004e2b6941b5c3953d43ae7ec24d41b1a928a6973"
            }
        }
    }
}

# 2 OpenC2 Language Binding

_This section is normative._

This section defines the set of Actions, Targets, Arguments, and Actuator Specifiers that are meaningful in the context of PF and the appropriate status codes, status texts, and other properties of a Response message. In addition, this section defines the Commands allowed by this Actuator profile. Section 2 is organized into three major subsections; [Command Components](2.1-openc2-command-components), [Response Components](2.2-openc2-response-components), and [Commands](2.3-openc2-commands).

Extensions to the Language Specification are defined in accordance with Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10), Section 3.1.4, where:

1. The unique name of the PF schema is: `http://oasis-open.org/openc2/ap-pf/v1.0` 
2. The namespace identifier (nsid) referring to the PF schema is:  `pf`
3. The conformance requirements for the OpenC2 Packet Filtering Actuator profile are defined and included in this document.

## 2.1 OpenC2 Command Components
The components of an OpenC2 Command include Actions, Targets, Actuators and associated Arguments and Specifiers. Appropriate aggregation of the components will define a Command-body that is meaningful in the context of PF.

This specification identifies the applicable components of an OpenC2 Command. The components of an OpenC2 Command include:

* Action:  A subset of the Actions defined in Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10) that are meaningful in the context of a packet filter.
    * This profile SHALL NOT define Actions that are external to Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10).
    * This profile MAY augment the definition of the Actions in the context of PF.
    * This profile SHALL NOT define Actions in a manner that is inconsistent with Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10).
* Target:  A subset of the Targets and Target-Specifiers defined in Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10) that are meaningful in the context of PF and two Targets and their Specifiers that are defined in this specification.
* Arguments:  A subset of the Arguments defined in Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10) and a set of Arguments defined in this specification.
* Actuator:  A set of Actuator Specifiers defined in this specification that are meaningful in the context of PF.

### 2.1.1 Actions
Table 2.1.1-1 presents the Actions defined in Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10) which are meaningful in the context of PF. The particular Action/Target pairs that are valid combinations are presented in [Section 2.3](#23-openc2-commands).

Arguments provide additional precision to a Command by including information such as how, when, or where a Command is to be executed. Table 2.1.3-1 lists the Command Arguments defined in Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10) as they relate to PF functionality. Table 2.1.3-2 lists the Command Arguments that are defined in this profile. Command Arguments that are defined in this profile (see Table 2.1.3-2) are referenced with the `pf` namespace identifier.

**Table 2.1.3-1 Common Command Arguments Applicable to PF**

**_Type: Args (Map)_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **start_time** | Date-Time | 0..1 | The specific date/time to initiate the Command. |
| 2 | **stop_time** | Date-Time | 0..1 | The specific date/time to terminate the Command.|
| 3 | **duration** | Duration | 0..1 | The length of time for a Command to be in effect. |
| 4 | **response_requested** | Response-Type | 0..1 | The type of Response required for the Command: `none`, `ack`, `status`, `complete`. |

**Table 2.1.3-2 Command Arguments Unique to PF**

**_Type: Args (Map)_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1024 | **drop_process** | Drop-Process | 0..1 | Specifies how to handle denied packets. |
| 1025 | **persistent** | Boolean | 0..1 | Normal operations assume any changes to a device are to be implemented persistently. Setting the persistent modifier to FALSE results in a change that is not persistent in the event of a reboot or restart. |
| 1026 | **direction** | Direction | 0..1 | Specifies whether to apply rules to incoming or outgoing traffic. If omitted, rules are applied to ingress packets. |
| 1027 | **insert_rule** | Rule-ID | 0..1 | Specifies the identifier of the rule within a list, typically used in a top-down rule list. |
| 1028 | **logged** | Boolean | 0..1 | Specifies if a log entry should be recorded as traffic matches the rule. The manner and mechanism for recording these entries is implementation specific and not defined by this specification. |
| 1029 | **description** | String | 0..1| A note to annotate or provide information regarding the rule. |
| 1030 | **stateful** | Boolean | 0..1 | Specifies if the actuator should treat the request using state tables or connection state. |
| 1031 | **priority** | Integer | 0..1 | Specifies the priority of a specific firewall rule for firewalls that assign a numeric priority. It is used to determine which firewall rule takes precedence. |

Usage Requirements:
* insert_rule:
    * The value MUST be immutable - i.e., the identifier assigned to an access rule at creation must not change over the lifetime of that rule.
    * The value MUST be unique within the scope of an Openc2 Producer and an Openc2 Consumer - i.e., the value MUST map to exactly one 'deny [target]' or 'allow [target]' for a given instance of a PF.
* directionality:
    * If absent or not explicitly set, then the Command MUST apply to ingress packets.
* drop_process: If absent or not explicitly set, then the Actuator MUST NOT send any notification to the source of the packet.
* persistent: If absent or not explicitly set, then the value is TRUE and any changes are persistent.
* stateful:
    * If absent or not explicitly set, and the Actuator only operates in either stateful or stateless, the Command MUST apply as if this Argument was appropriately specified (e.g., stateful for Google Cloud Platform). 
    * If the Actuator supports both mechanisms and this Argument is absent or not explicitly set, then it MUST treat the command as if the Argument was set to stateless in order to be backwards compatible with Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Stateless Packet Filtering Actuator Profile ([[OpenC2-SLPF-v1.0]](#openc2-slpf-v10)).
    
Note that direction is required by some packet filters. For a host-based or host interface-based packet filter, ingress indicates a packet that originated from a different host. For a network-based packet filter, such as a router or a switch, ingress indicates a packet entering a physical or logical interface that your organization controls.

### 2.1.4 Actuator Specifiers
An Actuator is the entity that provides the functionality and performs the Action. The Actuator executes the Action on the Target. In the context of this profile, the Actuator is the packet filter and the presence of one or more Specifiers further refine which Actuator(s) shall execute the Action.

Table 2.1.4-1 lists the Specifiers that are applicable to the PF Actuator. [Appendix E](#appendix-e-sample-commands) provides sample Commands with the use of Specifiers. The Actuator Specifiers defined in this profile are referenced with the `pf` namespace identifier.

Additional details regarding Commands and associated Responses are captured in [Section 2.3](#23-openc2-commands). Examples are provided in [Appendix E](#appendix-e-sample-commands). The structure of an OpenC2 Response is defined in Section 3.3.2 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10).

### 2.2.1 Response Results 

Table 2.2.1-1 lists the Response Results properties defined in Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10) that are applicable to PF and associated with the 'query features' Command. Table 2.2.1-2 extends the list of common Response Results properties and includes additional properties unique to PF. Response Results properties that are defined in this profile (see Table 2.2.1-2) are referenced with the `pf` namespace identifier.

**Table 2.2.1-1 Common Response Results Applicable to PF**

Table 2.2.2-1 lists the Response Status Codes defined in Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10) that are applicable to PF.

**Table 2.2.2-1 Response Status Codes**

**_Type: Status-Code (Enumerated.ID)_**

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 102 | **Processing** - an interim Response used to inform the Producer that the Consumer has accepted the Command but has not yet completed it. |
| 200 | **OK** - the Command has succeeded. |
| 400 | **Bad Request** - the Consumer cannot process the Command due to something that is perceived to be a Producer error (e.g., malformed Command syntax). |
| 500 | **Internal Error** - the Consumer encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from performing the Command. For "response_requested" value "complete", one of the following MAY apply:<br> * Cannot access file or path<br> * Rule number currently in use<br> * Rule not updated |
| 501  |**Not Implemented** - the Consumer does not support the functionality required to perform the Command. For "response_requested" value "complete", one of the following MAY apply:<br> * Target not supported<br> * Argument not supported<br> * Command not supported |

## 2.3 OpenC2 Commands

An OpenC2 Command consists of an Action/Target pair and associated Specifiers and Arguments. This section enumerates the Commands permitted by this Actuator profile and presents the associated Response behavior. Sections 2.3.1 to 2.3.5 provide details applicable to each Command, also as influenced by the Arguments.

Table 2.3-1 defines the Commands that are valid in the context of the PF profile. An Action (the top row in Table 2.3-1) paired with a Target (the first column in Table 2.3-1) defines a valid Command. 

**Table 2.3-1. Command Matrix**

# Appendix E. Sample Commands

_This section is non-normative_.

This section will summarize and provide examples of OpenC2 Commands as they pertain to packet filters. The sample Commands will be encoded in verbose JSON, however other encodings are possible provided the Command is validated against the property tables defined in [Section 2.1](#21-openc2-command-components) of this specification. Examples of corresponding Responses are provided where appropriate.

The samples provided in this section are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be interpreted as operational examples for actual systems.

The following examples include Binary fields which are encoded in Base64url format. The examples show JSON-serialized Commands; the conversion of Base64url values to Binary data and String display text is:

| Base64url | Binary | Display String |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `AQIDBA` | `01020304` | `1.2.3.4` |
| `xgIDBA` | `c6020304` | `198.2.3.4` |
| `xjNkEQ` | `c6336411` | `198.51.100.17` |

The examples include Integer Date-Time fields; the conversion of Integer values to String display text is:

| Integer | Display String |
| :--- | :--- |
| `1534775460000` | `Monday, August 20, 2018 2:31:00 PM GMT, 2018-08-20T10:31:00-04:00` |

=======
## E.1 Deny and Allow

Deny and allow can be treated as mathematical complements of each other. Unless otherwise stated, the example Targets, Specifiers, Arguments and corresponding Responses are applicable to both Actions.

### E.1.1 Deny a particular connection
Block a particular connection within the domain and do not send a host unreachable. Note that the drop_process argument does not apply to the allow Action.

**Command:**

~~~
{
    "action":"deny",
    "target":{
        "ipv4_connection":{
            "protocol":"tcp",
            "src_addr":"1.2.3.4",
            "src_port":10996,
            "dst_addr":"198.2.3.4",
            "dst_port":80
        }
    },
    "args":{
        "start_time":1534775460000,
        "duration":500,
        "response_requested":"ack",
        "pf":{
            "drop_process":"none"
        }
    },
    "actuator":{
        "pf":{
            "asset_id":"30"
        }
    }
}
~~~

**Response:**

~~~
{
    "status":102
}
~~~

### E.1.2 Deny all outbound ftp transfers 
Block all outbound ftp data transfers, send false acknowledgment. Note that the five-tuple is incomplete. Note that the response_requested field was not populated therefore will be 'complete'. Also note that the Actuator called out was PF with no additional Specifiers, therefore all endpoints that can execute the Command should. Note that the drop_process argument does not apply to the allow Action.

**Command:**

~~~
{
    "action":"deny",
    "target":{
        "ipv4_connection":{
            "protocol":"tcp",
            "src_port":21
        }
    },
    "args":{
        "pf":{
            "drop_process":"false_ack",
            "direction":"egress"
        }
    },
    "actuator":{
        "pf":{
            
        }
    }
}
~~~

**Responses:**

Case 1: the Actuator successfully issued the deny.

~~~
{
    "status":200
}
~~~

Case 2: the Command failed due to a syntax error in the Command. Optional status text is ignored by the Producer, but may be added to provide error details for debugging or logging.

~~~
{
    "status":400,
    "status_text":"Validation Error: Target: ip_conection"
}
~~~

Case 3: the Command failed because an Argument was not supported.

~~~
{
    "status":501
}
~~~

### E.1.3 Block all inbound traffic from a particular source
Block all inbound traffic from the specified ipv6 network and do not send any response back to the producer. In this case the ipv6_net Target and the direction argument was used. In this case only the perimeter filters should update the rule.

**Command:**

~~~
{
    "action":"deny",
    "target":{
        "ipv6_net":"3ffe:1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf"
    },
    "args":{
        "response_requested":"none",
        "pf":{
            "direction":"ingress"
        }
    },
    "actuator":{
        "pf":{
            "named_group":"perimeter"
        }
    }
}
~~~

### E.1.4 Statefully permit ftp transfers to a particular destination
Permit ftp data transfers to 3ffe:1900:4545:3::f8ff:fe21:67cf from any initiating source and allow needed return traffic. (Note that an actual application may also need to allow ftp-data (port 20) in order for transfers to be permitted depending on the ftp connection type and the firewall technology).


**Command:**

~~~
{
    "action":"allow",
    "target":{
        "ipv6_connection":{
            "protocol":"tcp",
            "dst_addr":"3ffe:1900:4545:3::f8ff:fe21:67cf",
            "src_port":21
        }
    },
    "args":{
        "pf":{
            "stateful":true
        }
    },
    "actuator":{
        "pf":{
            
        }
    }
}
~~~

In this case the Actuator returned a rule number associated with the allow.

**Response:**

~~~
{
    "status":200,
    "results":{
        "pf":{
            "rule_number":1234
        }
    }
}
~~~
    
### E.1.5 Deny outbound Network Time Protocol (NTP)
From a tagged set of webservers in the default virtual network, traffic requests from these servers to timekeeping services will be denied.


**Command:**

~~~
{
    "action":"deny",
    "target":{
        "pf":{
            "advanced_connection":{
                "src_addr":"webservers",
                "network":"default",
                "protocol":"udp",
                "dst_port":123
            }
        }
    },
    "args":{
        "pf":{
            "direction":"egress",
            "priority":500
        }
    },
    "actuator":{
        "pf":{
            
        }
    }
}
~~~
    
## E.2 Delete Rule
Used to remove a firewall rule rather than issue an allow or deny to counteract the effect of an existing rule. In this case the rule number assigned by the actuator in a previous allow will be removed (refer to the example [E.1.4](e14-statefully-permit-ftp-transfers-to-a-particular-destination).

**Command:**

~~~
{
    "action":"delete",
    "target":{
        "pf:rule_number":1234
    },
    "args":{
        "response_requested":"complete"
    },
    "actuator":{
        "pf":{
            
        }
    }
}
~~~

## E.3 Update file
Update is intended for the device to process new configuration files. The update Action is a compound Action in that all of the steps required for a successful update (such as download the new file, install the file, reboot etc.) are implied. File is the only valid Target type for Update.

The command below instructs the firewalls to acquire a new configuration file. Note that all network based firewalls will install the new update because no particular firewall was identified. Host based firewalls will not act on this because network firewalls were identified as the Actuator.

**Command:**

~~~
{
    "action":"update",
    "target":{
        "file":{
            "path":"\\\\someshared-drive\\somedirectory\\configurations",
            "name":"firewallconfiguration.txt"
        }
    },
    "actuator":{
        "pf":{
            "named_group":"network"
        }
    }
}
~~~

**Responses:**

Case 1: successful update of the configuration.

~~~
{
    "status":200
}
~~~

Case 2: this Actuator does not support the update file Command.

~~~
{
    "status":501,
    "status_text":"Update-File Not Implemented"
}
~~~

Case 3: this Actuator could not access the file.

~~~
{
    "status":500,
    "status_text":"Server error. Cannot access file"
}
~~~

## E.4 Query features
The 'query features' Command is intended to enable the Openc2 Producer to determine the capabilities of the Actuator. The 'query features' Command can also be used to check the status of the Actuator.

### E.4.1 No query items set
This Command uses 'query features' with no query items to verify that the Actuator is functioning.

**Command:**

~~~
{
    "action":"query",
    "target":{
        "features":[
            
        ]
    }
}
~~~

**Response:**

The Actuator is alive.

~~~
{
    "status":200
}
~~~

### E.4.2 Version of Language specification supported
This Command queries the Actuator to determine which version(s) of the Language Specification are supported. The Language Specifications use semantic versioning ("major.minor"). For each supported major version, the Actuator needs only to report the highest supported minor version.

**Command:**

~~~
{
    "action":"query",
    "target":{
        "features":[
            "versions"
        ]
    }
}
~~~

**Response:**

The Actuator supports Language Specification Version 1.0.

~~~
{
    "status":200,
    "results":{
        "versions":[
            "1.0"
        ]
    }
}
~~~

### E.4.3 Actuator profiles supported
This Command queries the Actuator to determine both the language versions and the profiles supported.

**Command:**

~~~
{
    "action":"query",
    "target":{
        "features":[
            "versions",
            "profiles"
        ]
    }
}
~~~

**Response:**

The Actuator device is apparently a smart front-door-lock for which an extension profile has been written. The device supports both the standard pf functions and whatever Commands are defined in the extension profile.

~~~
{
    "status":200,
    "results":{
        "versions":[
            "1.3"
        ],
        "profiles":[
            "pf",
            "iot-front-door-lock"
        ]
    }
}
~~~

### E.4.4 Specific Commands Supported
This Command queries the Actuator to determine which Action/Target pairs are supported. Not all Targets are meaningful in the context of a specific Action, and although a Command such as "update ipv4_connection" may be syntactically valid, the combination does not specify an operation supported by the Actuator profile.

**Command:**

For each supported Action list the Targets supported by this Actuator.

~~~
{
    "action":"query",
    "target":{
        "features":[
            "pairs"
        ]
    }
}
~~~

**Response:**

The Actuator supports the following Action/Target pairs.

~~~
{
    "status":200,
    "results":{
        "pairs":{
            "allow":[
                "ipv6_net",
                "ipv6_connection"
            ],
            "deny":[
                "ipv6_net",
                "ipv6_connection"
            ],
            "query":[
                "features"
            ],
            "delete":[
                "pf:rule_number"
            ],
            "update":[
                "file"
            ]
        }
    }
}
~~~

### E.4.5 Rule Details
This Command queries the Actuator to determine the Action, Target, and Argument values for a particular rule.

**Command:**

For each supported Action list the Targets supported by this Actuator.

~~~
{
    "action":"query",
    "target":{
        "pf:rule_number":20
    },
    "actuator":{
        "pf":{
            "asset_id":"30"
        }
    }
}
~~~

**Response:**

The Actuator returns information that could be used to reconstruct the rule.

~~~
{
    "status":200,
    "results":{
        "pf":{
            "rule_number":20,
            "action":"deny",
            "ipv4_connection":{
                "protocol":"tcp",
                "src_addr":"1.2.3.4",
                "src_port":10996,
                "dst_addr":"198.2.3.4",
                "dst_port":80
            },
            "args":{
                "drop_process":"false_ack",
                "direction":"egress"
            }
        }
    }
}
~~~
